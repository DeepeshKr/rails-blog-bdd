Create Article Feature Test -

Create a topic branch:
git checkout -b article-feature-success

Create a folder called features under spec directory:
mkdir spec/features

In that folder create a new file called creating_article_spec.rb: 
Open that file and add the following:

require "rails_helper"
RSpec.feature "Creating Articles" do 
scenario "A user creates a new article" do
visit "/"
click_link "New Article"
fill_in "Title", with: "Creating a blog" 
fill_in "Body", with: "Lorem Ipsum" 
click_button "Create Article"
expect(page).to have_content("Article has been created")
expect(page.current_path).to eq(articles_path) 
end
end

Now save the file type this to run the spec (or you can just type rspec to run all specs):
rspec spec/features/creating_article_spec.rb

You get a routing error that suggests to create a root path
Update the routes.rb file in the config folder like below:
root to: "articles#index"

Now save and run rspec spec/features/creating_article_spec.rb
again.
You get an error that says: Uninitialized constant ArticlesController. This suggests to create the Articles Controller

Generate an articles controller with an index action by issuing the following command:
rails g controller articles index

Remove the get 'articles/index' line from the routes.rb file

Saveï¿¼ and run rspec again. 
The next error message suggests to add the "New Article" link
